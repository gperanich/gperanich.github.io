I"™<p>Several industries (construction, agriculture, etc) have seen a rise in drone use to monitor projects. Hovr was built to automate this process. In app, routes can be plotted out using Google Maps. If flying around a building, a model of the building may also be created. These routes are pushed to Amazon's IoT. At the push of a button, the partnered drone will take off and film the prescribed route.</p>
